			<h4> Nicole Wilkinson is a rising senior from San Francisco, California. She enjoys running, soccer, and hiking, but had never been backpacking before she and two friends hiked Section L of the PCT July of 2017. Before the trip, she was unable to find a comprehensive site with backpacking tips directed at beginners, and the idea for Trail Blazer was born.</h4>
