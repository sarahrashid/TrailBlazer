      	Three girls, three days, 40 miles, mosquito bites, and a lot of pain. July of 2017, two of my friends and I embarked on Section L of the Pacific Crest Trail northbound, a 39.6 mile CA section spanning from Donner Summit at the I-80 to Sierra City at Highway 49. The trail followed multiple mountain ridges, but was a net descent, starting at 7,200 ft in elevation and ending at 4,500 ft.

    <div class="well">
       <p style="font-size:18px;">
        <strong>Day One:</strong> <br>
        We arrived at the trailhead at 9:30 am and were on the trail by 9:45. We began at an elevation of 7,200 ft, climbed to 8,400 for the first pass, called Castle Pass. No snow until the downhills, which was quite managable. Lunch was two PROBAR meal bars at around 12:30. We ended at the day at 8,000 ft after 9.92 miles, choosing to stop and set up camp on the third ridge, near White Rock Lake, at 4:00 pm. Ample water sources until camp.<br><br>
        <strong>Day Two:</strong><br>
        The plan for the day was to complete 16 miles. We woke up at 6:30, boiled water, ate breakfast, and packed up camp. We filtered water at the first stream we came across, and were thoroughly on our way by 8:30 am. Lunch was salami sandwiches at around 12:00 near Bear Valley. By 3:30 we still had 5 miles to go and limited water supply, and began booking it downhill, stopping at 7:30 pm to camp near Jackson Meadows Reservoir and Pass Creek for a total of 17 miles over 11 hours. Easier to camp near a water source this time, but less beautiful views. Backpacker's Pantry freeze dried mashed potatoes and pepper steak were a great end to an exhausting day.<br><br>
        <strong>Day Three:</strong><br>
        13 miles left. We woke up at 6:30 am again, and were hiking by 8:30 with a determination to be at Highway 49 by 3:00 pm. Lunch was PROBAR meal bars around 11:30 after some grueling downhill switchbacks. The sun was a problem during this stretch of the section, and UV-protected sunglasses came in handy. We reached Highway 49 at 3, as expected.

       <p style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;"><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
       -  Trekking poles were absolutely crucial. <br>
       -  Make sure your boots fit properly and are worn in. <br>
       -  Salami is a perfect for the trail. <br>
       -  Bring an apple per person for the first day. <br>
       - Don't keep anything that melts inside your "brain", or top of your pack.
